# Nefarius.Peripherals.SerialPort

Originally copied from http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc301786.aspx that I guess licensed under Ms-PL so this project is also under Ms-PL. (Update: well, after the years now I think this was not a true claim, but well I don't think MS will sue anyone because a sample intended for public use)

It is useful in the cases System.IO.Ports.SerialPort is not working well (for connecting to \\\\.\\... devices)

Download it from https://nuget.org/packages/PInvokeSerialPort :)
